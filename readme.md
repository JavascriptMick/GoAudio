# GoAudio ðŸŽ¶

[![Build

GoAudio is an audio processing library, currently supporting `WAVE` files, although some tools such
as the synth and breakpoints are langauge-agnostic, so you could combine them with a different
library for storing the data and using GoAudio only as a means to generate the waveforms.

# Key Features

- Wave file handling (READ / WRITE Wave files)
- Synthesizer (Create oscillator of different shapes)
- Breakpoints (create automation tracks)

If you want to know more about how this code works and what you can do with it, I write about this code and other audio related programs over on my [blog:
